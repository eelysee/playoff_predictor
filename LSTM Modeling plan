LSTM

Season Long Trends: LSTMs can take into account the entire season's performance, capturing the long-term dependencies and trends.

Recent Performance: You can design the model or pre-process the data in a way that gives more weight to the most recent games, addressing your concern for capturing the team's current form.

Feature Rich: LSTMs can handle multiple features (like player statistics, game outcomes, etc.) making them versatile for complex tasks.

Temporal Dynamics: LSTMs are good at understanding the order of events, which is crucial in sports analytics where the sequence of games and events within those games can be highly influential.

However, there are some considerations:

Computational Cost: LSTMs can be computationally expensive and may require fine-tuning.

Overfitting: Due to their complexity, LSTMs are prone to overfitting, especially when the dataset is small. But this can be mitigated using techniques like dropout, regularization, and early stopping.

Data Preprocessing: Your data needs to be well-preprocessed and sequenced correctly for effective training.

For your specific case, where you want to give more weight to recent games, you could experiment with:

Decaying Weight Scheme: Older games could be given less weight during training.

Window-based Training: Use a rolling window approach where the model is retrained frequently with higher emphasis on the recent games.

LSTMs are a good match for your use-case given your focus on capturing both long-term and short-term trends in the data.




Steps for LSTM Implementation:
Data Preparation:

Gather your team statistics and game outcomes for the entire season.
Normalize the features to ensure they are all on the same scale.
Sequence Creation:

Transform the data into sequences that can be fed into the LSTM. You could choose a fixed-length sequence for each team's games.
Time-Weighting:

Apply a decaying weight scheme or similar approach to give more importance to recent games. This could be done in the data preprocessing stage or within the model itself.
Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that the sequence integrity is maintained.
Model Architecture:

Design the LSTM layers, and decide on the number of units, activation functions, dropout rates, etc.
Training:

Train the model using the training set. Monitor both training and validation loss to watch for overfitting.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using the testing set. Metrics like accuracy, F1-score, or custom sports analytics metrics could be used.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Based on the model evaluation, you may need to go back and adjust the model architecture, sequence length, or other hyperparameters.
Deployment:

Once the model performs satisfactorily, it can be deployed for predicting future games.
Retraining:

Optionally, the model can be retrained at regular intervals to include more recent games, especially if you're using a rolling window approach.
Tools and Libraries:
Python packages like Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for basic machine learning tasks like train-test split and normalization.
TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the LSTM model.


## Speeding up experimentation

Strategies to Speed Up Experimentation:
Early Stopping: You can use early stopping to halt the training process when the model's performance stops improving on a held-out validation dataset.

Checkpoints: Save checkpoints of your model's weights during training. This allows you to revert back to a previous state if the model starts to overfit.

Grid Search: Though time-consuming, this can automate the hyperparameter tuning process. Given your time constraints, a random search might be more practical.

Reduce Data: Initially, you can train your model on a subset of the data to check if the model architecture is sensible. Once confirmed, you can train on the full dataset.

Train a Baseline Model: Before diving into complex architectures, develop a simple model that you understand well and that performs reasonably. This provides you with a performance baseline and a point of comparison for more complex models.
