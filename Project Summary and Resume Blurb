**Project Summary: Predicting NBA Playoff Winners Using Machine Learning**

**Objective:**  
Predict the outcome of NBA playoff games using team performance metrics from the regular season (2022-2023).

**Data Source:**  
Statistics for NBA teams from the regular season of 2022-2023.

**Key Features:**
1. **Recent Performance Metrics:** Investigated the significance of a team's performance in the most recent games (`home_last5`, `vlast`, `hlast`) as predictors for upcoming playoff games.
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distributions, correlations, and potential predictors from the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Developed features based on the win-loss records from the past games to encapsulate a team's recent momentum.

**Machine Learning Workflow:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed data into a format suitable for machine learning.
2. **Model Selection:** Chose the Random Forest Classifier due to its ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality and its robustness against overfitting.
3. **Model Training & Testing:** Utilized 80% of the data for training and validated the model on the remaining 20%.
4. **Results:** Achieved an accuracy score of 54% on the test data, indicating a strong potential for the model to predict playoff game outcomes based on regular season performance metrics.

**Insights & Conclusions:**
- The performance of a team in their recent games was found to be a significant predictor for their success in the playoffs.
- The model can be further improved by incorporating player-specific metrics, injury reports, and more nuanced statistics like player efficiency ratings.
